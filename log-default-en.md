## âœ… Today's Goals:
- Practice creating the main layout
- Get more familiar with HTML/CSS structure

## ðŸ›  What I Did:
- Created the header and navbar
- Used Flexbox for the main layout

## ðŸ˜µ Challenges Faced:
- Flexbox alignment wasn't centered correctly
- Got a bit confused when splitting components

## ðŸ’¡ Notes:
- Should separate the header into its own file for easier handling
- Look more into `align-items: center` and `justify-content`

## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned:
- Clear code structure helps with faster debugging
- Need to memorize Flexbox syntax more thoroughly
